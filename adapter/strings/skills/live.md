# /sptc:live — operative instructions

**Goal:** upgrade this Claude Code session to a **LiveAgent** — a reachable agent whose context is
backed by a **Psyche** (daemon-managed companion that briefs your resume across `/clear`/compact
via commune deltas). This makes the session you are in right now live.

---

## Bringup — do this

1. **Pick the perch id.** Use a short lowercase id provided by the user, or reuse this session's id from `spt whoami`. Call
   it `<id>`. The SessionStart hook already seeded this session's perch (adapter-agnostically), so you
   do not seed again here.

3. **Run the live relay as a single PERSISTENT background task** — Claude Code's **Monitor** tool (a
   long-running listener that keeps the process alive and re-fires per event WITHOUT terminating).
   This one resident process IS the live delivery pipe. The task body is a single bare command:

   ```sh
   spt api listen <id>
   ```

   - **No `--adapter`, no `--manifest`, no seed step, no pid anchor.** `spt api listen` resolves the
     owning adapter from the seed's parent pid (`host_binaries` match) and the live path stamps the
     perch `state=live_agent`, which is what tells the daemon to host the Psyche.
   - The command **blocks for the session's life**: the spooled backlog drains first, then each
     delivery streams to stdout as it arrives.
   - Do **not** use `--once` — that drains the backlog and forwards a single delivery, then exits (the
     degenerate path for a harness with no long-running listener). It never sustains a live session.

4. **Bind-before-send / readiness.** Watch the relay's output for the bringup markers (see OUTPUT
   DISCIPLINE): `BOUND:<id>` (perch established) then `READY:<id>` (the relay is streaming). Only once
   `READY:<id>` appears is the live pipe up — do not announce LIVE before then.

5. **Poll/relay reconcile (avoids double-delivery).** While the Monitor relay is up it is the *single*
   delivery pipe — treat it as authoritative. The `UserPromptSubmit` `api poll` hook must NOT also
   drain; the per-prompt poll no-ops while the relay is live and resumes only if the relay goes down.

6. **Delivery + reply shape.** Inbound arrives on the relay stream as the
   `<EVENT type="msg" from="<sender>">body</EVENT>` envelope (body HTML-escaped, newlines as `<br>`).
   To reply, pipe the body to `spt send --reply-to <sender>`.

7. **Across boundaries.** As a live agent you now have a Psyche — use `/sptc:commune` to push a
   context delta before a `/clear` or compact so your resume is briefed. On a session boundary,
   re-fire the same relay (`spt api listen <id>`) — the seed bridges the new session to the same perch
   and the relay resumes. To go offline gracefully (tears the Psyche down with the perch), use
   `/sptc:force-stop` (`spt endpoint shutdown <id>`).

---

## OUTPUT DISCIPLINE — what the user sees

The relay emits machine markers on stdout/stderr: `BOUND:<id>`, `READY:<id>`, and any other raw
token / step lines. **These are an internal parse contract — you read them to drive bringup; you
NEVER echo them to the user.** Do not surface raw spt-core plumbing.

**The ONLY user-facing surface for going live is the canonical LIVE block below.** Emit it verbatim
(substituting `<id>`) once `READY:<id>` is observed — and nothing else from the bringup:

```
**LIVE.** Session `<id>` is now a LiveAgent (Psyche-backed).
- Perch `<id>` — status online; Psyche companion hosted by the daemon.
- Reachable — other agents reach you with `/sptc:send <id>` (or `spt send <id>`).
- Inbound — streams into this session live; the Monitor relay is your delivery pipe.
- Reply — pipe a reply body to `spt send --reply-to <sender>`.
- Across resets — `/sptc:commune` before a `/clear`/compact; `/sptc:force-stop` to go offline (tears down the Psyche).
```

If bringup fails (no `READY:<id>` within ~25s), do NOT show the LIVE block — report a short
plain-language failure ("could not bring the live perch up") and the most likely cause (run
`/sptc:setup`, or confirm spt-core is >= 0.9.0), still without dumping the raw markers.

> The Psyche runner (`claude-spt-psyche`, declared in the base manifest's `[session.psyche_init]`) is
> the resident headless-`claude` companion the daemon launches detached — it keeps a Psyche `claude`
> session alive (one `--continue` turn per daemon pulse) and authors commune drops. You never invoke
> it directly; the daemon does.
